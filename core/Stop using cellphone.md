I just watched a video. It's about a person sharing his experience of not using his smartphone for seven days. At the beginning, he felt very uncomfortable because he got bored whenever he did something. For example, when he woke up, he forced himself not to use the cellphone since he had locked it in a box. 

So, when he woke up, he felt bored. Then, when he went outside, he realized that not having a cellphone was inconvenient because most Chinese people use their cellphones to pay their bills or find locations using map applications on the phone. Instead, he had to use the old - fashioned way of asking others for directions. 

Previously, he would listen to music, but without the cellphone, he just walked around the street feeling bored. However, there was one positive aspect. He could feel the environment. He could sense the wind and watch the snow. So, this was a different kind of experience.

And then when he had his breakfast, he also felt really uncomfortable because previously he would watch some videos at this time. Now, he was just eating breakfast without doing anything else. He experienced a lot of such things. He just felt so bored and then did other things. For example, he would clean his house, go outside, or do some reading. So, even though he felt really bored, he could take this time to do a lot of things. 


I just watched the whole video. Finally, he completed this challenge. At the end of the seven days, he realized that not using a cell phone in his life could make his life better. He could do a lot of things that made him more positive. Especially, not watching videos on the phone could really help with his sleep. Because if you use the cell phone, you might stay up late. When he didn't use the cell phone, he had enough time to read or do other things. 


So, I really agree with this kind of feeling. I want to give it a try too, but I think I'll still need to use the cell phone because I need some of its apps. For example, I need to use WeChat, Alipay, Taobao, and a map app. Right now, I've quit playing video games. And then I'll try not to watch videos on my cellphone for the next three days.


I can sense the positive aspects of stopping using my cell phone. In the past few hours, I stopped watching videos, and I found that I had a lot of time to do things I actually wanted to do. I even cleaned my house. When I went outside or had my dinner, I didn't use my cell phone either. I could feel that my mind became clearer. So, I will keep this up.

  

I also think that watching videos is really simple. When I do too much of the simplest things, like watching videos, I might not have enough motivation to do other challenging things. For example, right now, I need to pass my interview, which is really difficult. If I keep watching videos all the time, it might reduce my motivation. I realize that watching videos doesn't really make me excited. It just makes me feel less bored, but not in a fulfilling way. When I watch videos, I don't get enough joy, and instead, I feel guilty. So, why should I watch them?

  

I've decided that maybe every weekend or once a week, I'll allow myself two hours to watch some videos. But on weekdays, I don't want to spend more time on watching videos.
