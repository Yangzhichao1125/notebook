Now, let's explore database platform optimization. As backend developers, most of us are quite familiar with databases, and I have several thoughts on this topic.

### 1. Column Type Selection

The first crucial aspect is column type selection. When conducting code reviews, we often notice that some junior developers don't pay enough attention to this. It's essential to understand the benefits of each data type. For example, when dealing with strings, we have options like `VARCHAR` and `CHAR`. If you're storing an address, `VARCHAR` is a good choice as it can vary in length. For storing a cellphone number, which is usually 11 characters long, `CHAR(11)` is more appropriate.

Regarding date - related types, if you're storing a birthday, `DATE` is suitable. For an opening time, you might use `TIME`. And in most cases, we recommend using `TIMESTAMP` because our clients come from all over the world and different time zones. `TIMESTAMP` can handle time - zone differences better, making it more suitable for our system. These basic column - type details are something we always check during code reviews, as they are very important, yet some junior developers overlook them.

### 2. Index Creation

The second important point is index creation. You need to create appropriate indexes in your database tables. Creating too many indexes can slow down the process of inserting new data. For example, if you frequently query data using a particular column, you can add that column as an index. This helps speed up the query process.

### 3. Multiple Table Joins

Multiple table joins are often the biggest challenge in database optimization. In our project's attendance module, we faced such a challenge. We needed to calculate each company's employees' attendance situation for each month. This required joining four tables: the employee table, the attendance record table, the leave - request table (as employees might request holidays or days off), and the shift table.

We found that the original query took a long time to execute. By using MySQL's `EXPLAIN` statement, we analyzed the query. We noticed that for one of the tables, we needed to index five columns. So, we added the necessary indexes first. Also, instead of using the `SELECT *` statement, we specified the exact five columns we needed.

We also optimized the query by reducing sub - queries and narrowing down the data range. For example, since we were interested in monthly data, we specified the relevant time period. For each table, we reduced the number of records to be joined. As a result, we managed to reduce the response time from 20 seconds to 2 seconds.

In conclusion, these are the steps we took to optimize the database, covering column - type selection, index creation, and multiple - table join optimization.
