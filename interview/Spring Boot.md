Let's delve into Spring Boot. One of its core features is auto - configuration, and the underlying principle is "convention over configuration".

This principle implies that you only need to define a class in the `META - INF/spring.factories` file. When the project starts up, the project will read the `spring.factories` file. Additionally, when you add a starter in the `pom.xml` file, it means you're importing some classes. During the project startup, the project will scan classes annotated with `@ConditionalOnClass` or `@ConditionalOnMissingClass`. Based on these conditions, the project can determine which classes or components should be injected into the project. As a developer, you can focus on the properties. For instance, if you want to integrate Redis, you just need to add the Redis dependency in the `pom.xml` file. Then, you write the appropriate Redis configurations in the `application.yml` file, and you're ready to use Redis. This significantly reduces the need for writing a large amount of XML configuration files, thereby lightening the workload of programmers.

In our team, we also create custom starters. We use a third - party messaging service and customize it for SMS and email services. To create a custom starter, first, we define the name of the starter. Then, we define the properties of the starter and write them into the `spring.factories` file. Finally, we use `@ConditionalOnClass` or `@ConditionalOnMissingClass` annotations to ensure that our custom components can be used in our project.
