Hi, I'm Richard. I majored in Electronic Science and Technology at university. During my university years, I studied Java, and after graduation, I became a Java developer. Until now, I have 8 years of Java development experience. I'm familiar with mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and MyBatis. I can apply these technologies in projects, enabling me to develop web projects quickly and efficiently.

During my 8 - year Java development career, I also served as a technical project manager at Tencent for three years. In my previous position as a technical project manager, I led a team consisting of 10 members. We developed five projects, including a SaaS - based project. This project had 5 million daily active users, and the peak QPS (Queries Per Second) could reach 2000. That's all.
