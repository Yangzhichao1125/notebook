Today, I set aside some time to practice my English. For example, I spent time reading English documents and watching English videos. However, I realized that if I don’t speak English or engage in short oral exercises, my speaking skills will regress. I haven’t made any progress in my oral English recently, so I need to dedicate time to speaking aloud and practicing directly, rather than just reading or watching English materials.

I’m a bit confused about how to organize my daily routine because I know practicing oral English is important, but learning AI is also crucial for my career. I don’t know how to decide which should be my priority. The worst part is that I haven’t been able to focus on either—instead, I’ve just been feeling confused and wasting time playing video games these days.

Today, I found a set of AI learning videos online. I hope these courses can help me improve my artificial intelligence knowledge so that in one or two years, I can land a job in AI development and earn a higher salary in my career. Additionally, I recall that some videos recommend what I’m doing right now: recording my sentences to improve my oral English. I think if I watch AI videos and then summarize the knowledge by expressing it in English, I can not only improve my oral English but also solidify my AI knowledge and enhance my skills more effectively.
