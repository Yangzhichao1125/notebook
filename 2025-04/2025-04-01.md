I've decided to write some stories every day.
On the one hand, I'm interested in telling stories, and on the other hand, 
I think a lot of people like the sotries I tell.
I'll record a video every day to practice my telling skills, and I'll also take 
some time to translate these stories into English.
I feel that is a good practice, not only improve my stories content but also practice my English ability.
