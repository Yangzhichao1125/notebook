Today, I managed to run a use - case of DDD (Domain - Driven Design) with Cursor.
I originally thought that DDD was a lofty design concept, 
hard to understand and even more difficult to implement. 
Previously, I spent a lot of time learning the basic concepts of DDD, 
such as its architectural models.
I couldn't really grasp them.
If I were asked to design a system based on DDD according to a new requirement, 
I would feel very lost.
However, after implementing the user login requirement in code today, 
I realized that DDD is actually quite simple once you understand it.
In fact, it's not that different from the previously used MVC model. 
The core of DDD is decoupling. 
Whether it's in terms of technology or business, 
the design revolves around decoupling.
Compared with the MVC model, 
DDD adds a domainService layer to handle domain - related business logic.
The applicationService layer is used to integrate and call multiple domains. 
Another important aspect is the rich - domain model of entities. 
Compared with the anemic model that only has getters and setters, 
the rich - domain model allows operations on the entity's own behaviors.
As for the concept of the aggregate root, 
it is an entity in complex scenarios. 
For example, an order contains multiple sub - items and addresses.
After understanding these concepts, 
when coding or designing in the future, 
it's actually similar to before. 
We still split the system according to business rules.
Eventually, we break it down into individual tables, 
then write the classes for each required domain, 
and perform multi - domain calls at the applicationService layer.
