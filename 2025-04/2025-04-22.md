Today, I had a debate with my leader, but I lost.

I spent a day creating a set of data modules for my football match analysis.

I showed my module to my leader to demonstrate my thinking. My leader pointed out mistakes in my modules, and we discussed the related work for half an hour. I realized I made errors because I overfocused on how other colleagues might call my API to insert data, which led to poor module design.
