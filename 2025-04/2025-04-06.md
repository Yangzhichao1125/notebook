It's been a long time since I watched any technical videos. 
Since today is a weekend, I spent some time learning technical skills from the videos.
I think I've learned a lot because this course is aboutÂ **domain-driven design**. 
Previously, I knew that this skill was really important, but I hadn't taken any time to study it.
So today, I took some time to learn some fundamental knowledge from the videos.
I think it will take me several weeks or even several months to master this skill, but I'm determined to learn it because it's really crucial for my career.

I'm a little worried about my future career because of the rapid development of AI tools.
Maybe my position will be replaced by AI tools. 
So I must learn new things to safeguard my career.
Previously, I used to think that learning some technical skills might be useless for my future. However, who can really tell? 
I think the most important thing is that one needs to allocate some time for learning. 
It's all about enhancing one's learning ability. So, just keep learning.

Recently, I've realized that domain-driven design is really crucial for my job, so I should set aside some time to study it. 
That's exactly what I think. 
Also, today's video taught me that if I want to get a promotion, I should keep learning technical skills.
Besides, I also need to thoroughly consider the job requirements. 
Moreover, if I aim to advance my position, I need to acquire some knowledge about management.
