Today, I had a conversation with a vlogger. He is also a developer. Previously, he shared some videos on social media, and I learned some methods from him on how to practice my English.

I paid him 200 yuan for this conversation. I guess the information I got from it is really worth the money.

Previously, I wanted to find a remote job. As for the salary, I expected to earn between 4,000 and 5,000 dollars per month. So I sent a lot of resumes to foreign companies, but I received very little response. 

Today, I talked with this developer, and he told me that if I want to find a remote job offering $4,000, it's really difficult. This is because foreign companies that offer 4,000 dollars usually want to hire a full stack developer.

For a backend developer, especially a Java developer, it's really hard to get such a high salary.

He suggests that I learn some skills related to AI. And if I'm really interested in getting a remote job, I should acquire full stack skills. I should learn not only JavaScript (JS) but also React.

I think I will learn some AI skills. They are really important for my career. Maybe later I will set aside some time to learn about full stack development. However, the top priority is to learn something about AI.
