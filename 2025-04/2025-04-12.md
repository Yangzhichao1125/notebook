I have many thoughts in this week.

The first thought is that I want to express my opinions to others. I've realized that when I try to express my thoughts, my behavior and gestures make me seem like an unreliable person. I don't want this situation. I want others to respect me. So, I need to express my thoughts more clearly so that others may think I am a reliable individual and can trust me. Therefore, I think I will practice expressing my thoughts every day and record them in my diary.

When I reported my work tasks at my job, I didn't do it well because I expressed my thoughts too directly. I described the situation straightforwardly, and I noticed that my leader and colleagues used some nice words to make their tasks and work sound more appealing. So, I learned something from that experience. When I encounter a task or need to report on my work in the future, I will look for better words or find other ways instead of being so direct in describing my job. I will use some well-chosen words to make my reports seem more reliable and gain the respect of others.

I also realize that I desire a lot of things. For example, I want financial freedom, I want others to respect me, and I also want my life not to be so difficult or hard. This is because if I want to achieve my goals, I need to learn a great deal. So, I think I'm asking for too much. Maybe I should lower my expectations and make myself focus on just one aspect.

Maybe the most important thing I want to achieve is to gain the respect of others. Previously, I thought the most important goal for myself was to achieve financial freedom. But when I got this job, which pays me a higher salary, I realized it was pretty good for me. That feeling made me feel really satisfied. Maybe it's not just about financial freedom. Maybe it's the feeling of being able to do something that others can't, which makes others respect me. That sense of being respected made me feel great. So, maybe I should just focus on one thing: gaining respect from others. If I want to achieve this goal, I think I need to improve many aspects of my behavior. For example, I should improve my communication skills and change my daily routine. I used to spend a lot of time on things that I thought were important. But if I want to focus on earning respect, I think I need to change my approach.
