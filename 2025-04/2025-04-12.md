I have many thoughts in this week.

The first thought is that I want to express my opinions to others. I've realized that when I try to express my thoughts, my behavior and gestures make me seem like an unreliable person. I don't want this situation. I want others to respect me. So, I need to express my thoughts more clearly so that others may think I am a reliable individual and can trust me. Therefore, I think I will practice expressing my thoughts every day and record them in my diary.

When I reported my work tasks at my job, I didn't do it well because I expressed my thoughts too directly. I described the situation straightforwardly, and I noticed that my leader and colleagues used some nice words to make their tasks and work sound more appealing. So, I learned something from that experience. When I encounter a task or need to report on my work in the future, I will look for better words or find other ways instead of being so direct in describing my job. I will use some well-chosen words to make my reports seem more reliable and gain the respect of others.

I also realize that I desire a lot of things. For example, I want financial freedom, I want others to respect me, and I also want my life not to be so difficult or hard. This is because if I want to achieve my goals, I need to learn a great deal. So, I think I'm asking for too much. Maybe I should lower my expectations and make myself focus on just one aspect.
