This morning, I participated in an interview. Before the interview, I felt really nervous. Maybe it was because yesterday I planned to prepare for only about five questions, and I just prepared only one of them. So, I felt very nervous because I didn't prepare well. However, during the conversation with the interviewer, I was able to express my thoughts and key points effectively.

  

The main problem was that although the position was advertised as remote, I was informed that I would need to go to Hong Kong and live there. Even though it was presented as remote work, the requirement to live in Hong Kong meant it wasn't what I was looking for. 


Right now, I'm feeling anxious. Maybe it's because I haven't sent out my resume in recent days, and I'm wondering if I can successfully secure a remote job interview. I'm also questioning if my strategy of focusing on remote jobs is correct. Given that this position requires me to live in Hong Kong, it seems my initial assumptions were wrong. I'm starting to think that remote jobs might not be suitable for backend work, especially for someone in China. That's why I'm feeling anxious.


After the interview, I didn't take the time to prepare more interview questions or spend time enhancing my interview skills. I just felt anxious. Then, I took a nap. When I woke up, I still didn't feel like making an effort to learn. I guess I have to push myself to do these things. At least, I need to improve my English skills. Right now, although I can express my thoughts clearly, I have a problem with my listening skills. They aren't very good, and I need to work on them. I think having conversations with an AI application is really useful. So, currently, I'm talking to AI tools to refine my sentences.


I found that about a month ago, when I watched a TV show, if I didn't watch the subtitles, I couldn't understand what they were talking about. Right now, when I watch a short video without subtitles, I can understand what they're trying to say, and I can clearly hear almost every vocabulary item. I think this is because in recent days I've been talking to an AI application and recording videos. So, I believe this approach is really beneficial for my English skills. I'll continue to do this in the long run. It's helpful not only for my spoken English but also for my interview skills and other aspects. This strategy is truly useful to me.
