Yesterday, I forced myself not to watch videos, so I had a lot of time. However, I didn't prepare my resume because I thought it was really difficult. But today, I will force myself to complete it.


Yesterday, since I had a lot of time, I read the English bookÂ _Harry Potter_, and I have finished this book. This is the first time I've finished reading a book , and the content is really awesome. I read until 1:00 am and then went to bed.


I never thought I would like this book so much. Today, I woke up very early, around 4:00 am, and then I couldn't fall asleep again. So, I picked up the book and started reading until some time later. Then I fell asleep again. When I got up, I continued to read the book. Throughout the whole day, whenever I had some free time and wasn't busy, I would pick up the book and start reading. 


Eventually, I finished it. Maybe it's because the content was really amazing and I just couldn't put it down. That's why I finished it.
