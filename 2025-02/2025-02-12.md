Yesterday, when I sent out my resume, I received a mock interview. It turned out to be an AI conducting the interview, and it asked me some technical questions. I answered them, but it seems I didn't answer them well. So today, I'm going to review the interview and find ways to improve my answers.

This morning, after having a conversation with my English teacher, I also participated in an English conversation with some foreign English learners. I found that I can express my thoughts, but my listening skills need to be improved. When I listen to the conversation and hear their pronunciation, they might have some accents or I might not be familiar with some vocabulary, so I can't understand what they're trying to express. I'm not sure if it's my listening skills that need improvement or if the other foreign English learners need to improve their expression skills.

After all, I had a conversation for about 1 hour. I think my spoken English is good enough to express my thoughts, and I think it's good enough for the interview. After the conversation, I felt a little tired and didn't want to practice for the interview. I know that's not right, but I just couldn't help feeling tired. Then I had my lunch and took a nap. Until now, I've forced myself to practice my English and interview skills because I really need to improve my responses to interview questions.

So I'm going to take two hours to practice how to answer the questions I came across yesterday. And then I'll also conduct a mock interview. That's what I'm going to do today.
