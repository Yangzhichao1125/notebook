I played video games for over 8 hours yesterday.
I can't stop myself from playing video games. There have been many times when I told myself that I should stop playing games, but in the end, I failed.
So I forced myself to uninstall this game app. I think maybe next weekend I can reinstall it and play, but during the weekdays, I just want to focus on improving my interview skills.
Maybe I spent a long time playing videos, so I couldn't sleep well last night.
Not only does the blue light affect my sleep, but also I feel anxious because I haven't taken enough time to improve my interview skills.
I'm afraid of the interview today. I even want to quit the interview. I feel so anxious. I hope someone could comfort me, but there is nobody. So I have to comfort myself and I need to force myself to do something challenging. I feel a little pain. But sometimes I realize that this kind of useless thinking and feeling helps nothing. So, I should stop thinking about this.
I think during the weekdays, the most crucial thing for me is to write a diary and stop watching entertainment videos. If I can achieve these two things, I think my life will become better.
