I don't know why I don't have enough motivation to practice answering my interview questions. Maybe it's because I have to do this kind of thing every day, so I feel really bored. Yesterday, I planned to practice my interview questions, but in the end, I spent that time practicing my coding skills instead. When I woke up today, I decided to spend some time practicing about 10 interview questions. However, after waking up, I just wanted to lounge around at home and watch some videos. Right now, I don't even have enough motivation to write down my diary. But I have to do it because next Monday I will participate in an interview, so I need to prepare for it.


I noticed that my voice isn't sweet. Yesterday, when I talked to myself and sent a voice message to myself, I heard that my voice sounded different from how I perceived it when I was talking to myself. In previous years, I thought my voice was sweet, and I could sing to myself, and I thought the songs sounded pretty good. But when I sent a voice message to myself and listened to it, it was really different from what I had in mind. So I just realized that maybe other people hear a different voice from the one I hear when I talk to myself.
