I've installed a new app to record some documents. These documents will include all the content from my notebooks. I plan to write my diary entries, and whenever I have thoughts, I'll jot them down in these documents. I'll write in English to practice my English writing (since writing is different from speaking, but both are beneficial for language improvement) and to record my thoughts. I think this is a great approach for me. If I can also upload all these records as an output to GitHub, I believe it will be a good habit. It can help me enhance my daily routine.



Yesterday, I studied some relationship courses. They taught me that appearance is extremely crucial in a relationship and also how to maintain a good one. This course consists of 11 episodes, and I've already completed three. After finishing each episode, I'll draw a conclusion and record my learnings in a document. I'll also commit this document to GitHub. I think this is a great idea as it can help me practice my summarization skills.

  

I believe that if you want to improve your communication skills, the key is to understand the main points others are making. Based on those key points, you can form your own thoughts and determine whether what they said is correct or not. So, I'm transcribing and recording their key points and thoughts. I think this will be good practice for enhancing both my thinking and communication abilities.
