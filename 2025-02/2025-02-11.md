I'm incredibly excited because I sent my resume to 10 different companies yesterday, and one of the companies has already responded, asking me to come in for an interview this Thursday morning. 

I was really lacking confidence in my pursuit of remote jobs just yesterday. Since I hadn't received any responses from the companies, I was feeling frustrated and anxious. I even thought that maybe it was a mistake for me to aim for remote work. I realized that I need to work on improving my mental attitude because whenever I lack confidence, I lose the motivation to work or practice for interviews. 

Yesterday, I was so anxious, but then this response came in and it's made me extremely excited. I was so thrilled that I couldn't fall asleep last night and ended up staying up really late. I'm hoping that now that I've received this first response, I'll start getting more from other companies. This is what's making me feel so excited.
