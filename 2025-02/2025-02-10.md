Today is Monday. While I know I should send out my resume and look for jobs online, for some reason, I'm reluctant to do so. Even though I dedicated a lot of time yesterday to practicing my interview skills, today I lack the motivation to start sending out my resume or searching for job opportunities on the internet. I realize I really ought to get this done. Perhaps it's because I'm not accustomed to this process that I'm disinclined to carry out this task. However, I've decided that I will do it today. I plan to send my resume to ten different companies. This is the top - priority task for me today.

Now, I remind myself that whenever I encounter a situation where I'm not willing to do something, I should refer to my personal characteristics. I've written down my advantages, disadvantages, and achievements, and all I need to do is review them. I realize that I need to become more diligent and also work on improving my mental attitude. This is really crucial for my growth.

My greatest achievement so far has been maintaining the habit of writing my diary, which I'm still doing. Every time I face problems or difficult tasks, I review these three aspects. It's proven to be quite useful, as I now find it less difficult to send out my resume.

I've realized that I've made some improvements in my spoken English and listening skills. Today, I had a conversation with my English teacher, and I could hear more clearly. Perhaps it's because in the past few days, I've been reviewing videos and writing down my thoughts in a document. This is a significant improvement in my English proficiency. I've decided that I'll continue doing these things every day.
