Today is Valentine's Day, and I haven't sent a message to my girlfriend. I'm not sure if she's still my girlfriend at the moment because during our last conversation, we agreed that maybe after I find a job, we can discuss our relationship. As a result, I haven't talked to her for over ten days, and even today, I still don't feel like sending her a message.


Today, I woke up very early and had some time to reflect on all my past relationships, especially my first love. I've had three girlfriends, and each of them was different. I've been thinking about what kind of love I truly want. I've come to the conclusion that I need a partner who can support me and encourage me to take on difficult tasks. That's all I really need.

  

When I think about my first relationship, I remember that whenever I was doing something challenging or even something ordinary, my ex - girlfriend would encourage me. That made me feel really good, and I truly miss that kind of emotional support. Right now, I wish my current girlfriend could support me because I'm dealing with something that's really difficult for me. But these days, instead of support, my girlfriend expects me to buy a house. I'm just so tired of this. This isn't what I want. If she insists on putting such demands on me, it will only deteriorate our relationship. I think if she's not willing to change, I'll break up with her. That's my stance.


Yesterday, I decided not to watch videos. I used to watch some videos when I got up. But today when I got up, I just lay on my bed and thought about something. I think that even though I felt a little uncomfortable at first, I had more time to do things and think deeply. That was really great. However, sometimes when I picked up my cell phone, I instinctively wanted to click the short - video button. I realize this is a bad habit that I need to break.


Let's talk about what I'm going to do today. Actually, I don't have enough confidence to send out my resume because in recent days I haven't received enough responses from companies. Sometimes I wonder if I've chosen the wrong approach. In fact, I don't need to dwell on this. Once I've chosen a path, I just need to act on it. That's all. No matter what it takes. So today, I'll send out my resume to 10 different companies and I'll work on enhancing my resume again. That's what I'm going to do today.
