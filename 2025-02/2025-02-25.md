I participated in a technical interview yesterday.

Before the interview, I felt really anxious because last weekend I didn't prepare for my interview questions and I wasn't really familiar with my resume. So, I felt extremely anxious, not just a little. I kept thinking that maybe the interviewer would ask me some difficult questions. As a result, I didn't sleep well because I was feeling anxious and I didn't want to prepare for my interview questions.

So I spent a lot of time preparing to answer interview questions. Yesterday morning, I thought it was really effective because I managed to answer those interview questions well.

And during the interview, I could almost answer all the questions that the interviewer asked me. So I'm really satisfied with this interview. After the interview, I felt relieved. I think I have passed the interview and I performed well. So, I just wanted to take a rest and then go to the court to play basketball.

And there were also some questions I couldn't answer well. So today, I will also spend some time answering these questions. Then, I will also send out my resume to some foreign companies. I really want to get a job where English is used as the working language.
