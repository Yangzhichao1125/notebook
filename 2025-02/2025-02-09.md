Yesterday, I recorded some videos. I find them quite useful as they can boost my confidence, help me express my thoughts, and improve my interview skills. I believe recording videos is a great strategy for me, so I'll keep doing it. Before recording a video, I'll write down my ideas in my diary or a document. I think this pre - recording writing can make my thoughts clearer. So, I consider this to be a good approach. 

I also spent some time deploying my AI tools. These days, the DeepSeek AI application has gained worldwide popularity. I've been using this website, and I find it quite good. It can think deeply, answer questions with insightful ideas, and provide me with many useful suggestions. I really like using this tool. However, there is an issue. Since so many people are using this AI tool, sometimes I can't get an answer, and at other times, it gives a network error response. That's why I decided to deploy the AI tools myself. This way, I can have a more convenient and smooth conversation experience.

Let's plan what I'll do today. I intend to record another 4 videos. The first one will be a Daily Record, where I'll essentially talk about what I'd write in my diary. For the remaining three videos, I'll focus on interview questions. I believe recording three such videos should be sufficient.
