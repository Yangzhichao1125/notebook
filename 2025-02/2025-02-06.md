Yesterday, I watched a movie, and I think it was really awesome. After watching it, I couldn't stop thinking about the story. On my way back to my apartment, the story was constantly on my mind. I truly felt that this movie was amazing.

  

After that, I spent some time practicing my spoken English. I transcribed some episodes into documents. I believe this can improve my spoken English skills, and I think it's a pretty good approach.


Today, I am acutely aware that I must fortify my mental strength as I am currently grappling with certain challenges. I'm experiencing a fair amount of unease regarding my career path. 

Lately, during my pursuit of remote job opportunities, I've yet to receive any favorable responses from the companies I've applied to. This lack of positive feedback has plunged me into a state of frustration. Each time I reflect on this situation, I'm overwhelmed with a sense of deep disappointment, which in turn has sapped my motivation to actively strive for career advancement. I'm fully cognizant that this mindset is far from ideal, yet I find myself struggling to summon the inner drive necessary to engage in the arduous tasks required.


I haven't made any preparations for interviews, nor have I dedicated time to practice my spoken English. As a result, I'm beset with a high level of anxiety. Nevertheless, starting from this very moment, I am resolutely determined to propel myself forward and take on these crucial tasks.

Today, I'll connect my notebook to my Mac and write my daily diary. I realize that, despite lacking the motivation to do this at the moment, I should still push myself to get it done.


tomorrow I'll take 6 hours to practice my interview skills.
