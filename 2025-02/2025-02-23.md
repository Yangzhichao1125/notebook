I find that watching some movie commentaries or anime commentaries can help me practice my English skills. Because compared to watching movies or anime directly, the commentators can express more sentences, which can help you remember English sentences. So I think it's an effective way to learn English, and I'm also interested in this approach.


I'm going to participate in an interview tomorrow, but there are still several questions that I haven't prepared for. So today, I will set aside some time to deal with this. Actually, right now, I still don't have enough motivation to practice math. Maybe it's because I spent so much time playing video games yesterday, so today I feel a bit tired. However, I will force myself to practice answering these interview questions because if I don't prepare well, I might feel extremely nervous tomorrow, and I really don't like that feeling. Therefore, I will practice the interview questions today.
