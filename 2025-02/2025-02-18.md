I can sense that I have made some improvements in my English skills. Today, when I talked to my English teacher, I could hear more clearly. Also, when I watched some English TV shows, I could almost understand 90% of what they were trying to express. So, I think I've really made significant improvements in my English skills. Maybe it's because these days I've been writing my diary, recording videos, and spending a lot of time reading books. These activities have helped me improve my English ability a great deal. I will continue to do these things because by not watching some videos, I can save a lot of time to practice my English.


Since my English abilities are sufficient, right now I need to focus on my interview skills. These days, I've spent a lot of time practicing my English. However, regarding my interview skills, I haven't taken enough time to practice. So, I will change my approach to interviews and spend more time on this aspect.

  

Yesterday, I participated in an interview, but I didn't perform well on the coding test. Therefore, I also need to set aside some time to practice my coding skills. Even though the interviews might be difficult, I have enough time to work on it, and I think that's okay.

  

Today, I should finish my Chinese resume. Yesterday, I planned to write it, but in the end, I only spent time reading English books. So, today the first and foremost thing is to revise my Chinese resume.
