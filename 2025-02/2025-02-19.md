These days, I force myself **not to** watch videos and play video games. But yesterday, I **couldn't** control **myself** anymore. So I **downloaded** a game app. And then I **played** until 5:00 am. I feel **disappointed** in myself because I can't stop myself **from** playing video games, and I also spend a lot of time watching videos. So I feel so frustrated. I'm not satisfied with this.

And today I woke up very late, at 12 o'clock am. After lunch, I also took two hours for a nap. Now I feel so energetic. Right now, I don't want to play video games or watch movies. I just need to calm myself down and focus on my interview skills. That's the most important thing. Even though I always tell myself I need to do this kind of thing, most of the time I just practice my English. So I need to send out my resume to some Chinese companies today.

First of all, the first thing I want to do is write down my diary. Yes, this is the most significant achievement I've made. So, to enhance this achievement, I'll write down my diary every day. Then, I'll push it to github and make myself feel more confident. I will also record a video today. After that, I want to call one of my friend to talk about our relationship. Maybe she can give me some good advice. And then I also want to do some workouts. Maybe I'll do 60 pull - ups or just go outside for a run.
