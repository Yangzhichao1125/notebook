I had a dream last night, and it made me feel really angry because I think I didn't perform well in the dream.

In the dream, I went to a restaurant with my cousin. And I made some tea. While I was making the tea, there was someone who always liked to discuss things with me. He just kept judging me. I didn't perform well when making the tea because in our place, everyone likes drinking tea. And some of them are really good at making tea. As for me, I just did it the way I usually do. I boiled the water and then poured it into a cup of tea. But for the people who are good at making tea, they had their own ways of making it. So they just kept judging me, and I felt so nervous that my hands were shaking. I just wanted to perform well, but when I woke up, I felt really angry. Why did I become so anxious? I was just making my tea, and I had nothing to do with that person. So I made the tea. I mean, that's all. When someone judges me, I feel like I could beat them. But when I woke up, I just regretted it. Why didn't I fight that person? I felt regretful and then angry.

When I woke up, I reflected on the dream. I think that when I encounter someone judging me or facing some problems where others argue with me, I always care about other people's feelings and ignore my own feelings. That's really not good. Maybe it's the result of the common education in China. Everyone around me has always told me that I need to take care of others' thoughts, but no one has ever told me to care about my own thoughts. So I keep wondering why I should feel so anxious and under pressure just to take care of others' feelings. It's not fair! What is truly best for myself? Taking care of other people's feelings definitely isn't the answer. I want to do things that make me feel better, things that give meaning to my life. I don't need to be overly concerned about other people's feelings. I just need to focus on my own feelings, make myself satisfied with my situation and the things I'm doing. This can make me feel comfortable and help me solve a lot of problems and achieve a great deal.
