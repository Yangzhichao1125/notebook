I feel a little angry with my team leader because there have been several times when he required us to attend a meeting. At that time, it was almost time to get off work. It was around 7 p.m. We were almost to go back to our apartment, and he required us to attend a meeting, which made us really angry.

Tomorrow, I'm going to my friend's apartment to visit them. I've also invited another friend to go there with me.

I spent two hours practicing my English reading skills today. I read some English articles and also used some website tools to help me read the articles aloud, which can improve my listening skills. I think it's really good for me to practice English in this way. However, maybe from next week on, I won't have this much time to practice my English anymore.
