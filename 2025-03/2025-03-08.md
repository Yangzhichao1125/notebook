I heard that Doubao has a new feature that can "think deeply". Because of this feature, I think I'll use Doubao more frequently. In the past, I only used Doubao to ask simple questions, but now I'll ask some profound ones.

Today is Saturday, and I really don't have enough motivation to learn new knowledge or skills. I just want to play video games, but I should spend some time preparing for my onboarding process because I might start an internship next week.
