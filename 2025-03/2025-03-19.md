Time seems to pass so quickly. When I got back to my apartment, it felt like I hadn't done anything. And now it's already 9:30. Even if I got back to my apartment as soon as possible, it would still be late at this hour. Maybe in a few days, I'll have to work overtime and get back to my apartment late. I'm not confident that I'll have the time to write my diary.

And today, I used a software program to generate some tools. They are really useful as they help me understand the project structure better.
