I watched a video just now about how to improve my English. These days, I've been thinking about how to practice English in my daily life. I didn't have a specific topic or plan for practicing English before. 

However, after watching the video just now, I have some ideas. Maybe I can watch TED videos every day. I could choose one TED video each day and watch it three or four times. Not only can I watch it, but I can also listen to it carefully and try to repeat what's said aloud.

I think this is a good way for me to practice English. If I have enough time and I fully understand the content of the video, I can even express it in my own words and record myself. I believe that if I keep practicing like this every day for about half an year, my English will improve significantly.
