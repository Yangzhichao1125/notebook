I almost forgot to write my diary today.

I felt so panicked today because the HR told me he would give me an answer about whether I would be hired or not. But I didn't receive the message until 7 PM. So, before I received the message, I felt so panicked. I just kept thinking that I might not get the job.

Then I sent my resume to other companies and received an invitation for an interview tomorrow. But I really don't have enough motivation to attend another interview. It's really difficult. So maybe I'll receive an offer from the HR tonight.
