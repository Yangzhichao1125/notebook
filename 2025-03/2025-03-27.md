Today, I downloaded a website application that can convert text to voice. So when I read some English text, I can use it to read aloud, which helps me practice my listening skills. I think it's really a useful tool for improving my listening ability.

I got up early this morning and spent one hour practicing my basketball skills. I found that I made great progress in my shooting skills again. After work, I also spent one hour playing badminton with my colleagues, which made me feel really excited.
