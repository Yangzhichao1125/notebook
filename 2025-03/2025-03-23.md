Maybe it's because now that I've got a job, I don't have enough motivation to learn new skills. However, I still spend several hours practicing my English. This morning, I spent two hours practicing my English. I also chose to write my diary, and I think that's a really good thing to do. But when it comes to my technical skills, I didn't spend any time practicing them this weekend.

I will read out my diary every day because the content is what I have written down. I think if I can say it out loud, it can help me practice my pronunciation and make me feel more confident about my grammar. For each sentence, I will ask an AI tool to correct my sentences. In this way, my sentence structures, grammar, and vocabulary usage will be correct. Thus, I can not only become familiar with my daily expressions, but also practice my grammar and vocabulary. Moreover, by reading aloud, I can practice my pronunciation. I think it will be a good strategy for my English learning.

And today, I also spent an hour playing basketball. I think it's good for my health, and I also had a lot of fun. Because today I improved my shooting skills. I increased my shooting percentage.. I felt really happy while playing basketball this morning. On weekdays, I also want to spend some time playing basketball in the morning. As for my technical skills, I don't know how to practice them. I'm not sure what time would be suitable for me to learn and practice them.
