I'm actually going to have a conversation with my girlfriend right now. I'm still not sure whether I have the determination to break up with her or not.

I'm just thinking that during this conversation, I'll ask her about our future. If she insists on having a house and expects me to pay a large amount for our future plans, I think I'll break up with her. I know I can contribute financially, but if she forces me into such a situation, I will definitely reject her demands.

But if this conversation makes me feel comfortable, and if she can understand that our future doesn't rely solely on me but on both of us, I think things will be okay. I'll still want to maintain the relationship with her. However, I'm not sure if she still loves me. Maybe she doesn't love me anymore. That's why we really need to have this conversation. Without having a talk, I won't be able to make any decision.

As for my English teacher, I will also have a conversation with her, but I won't support her financially anymore. I think there's a real possibility that she has deceived me. She shouldn't keep asking me for money. Even if she has a serious health problem, I won't support her again because as a friend, I've already been more than generous. I supported her once, but this time, I'm determined not to. It's simply not my responsibility. Anyway, if she insists on asking me for money, I will definitely stop having any conversations with her.
