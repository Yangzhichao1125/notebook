My English teacher said she had a problem with her body and couldn't afford the medical expenses. She is going to have an operation, but the cost is beyond her means. So she asked me to support her financially. It seems like a large sum of money. It's about 10,000 yuan. It's really a huge amount for her at present. For me, it's also a significant sum of money, so I feel a bit uncertain. I'm not sure whether she is deceiving me or not.

This time, even if the situation is true, I'm not going to support her. I think so because last time I lent her about 4,000 yuan. And now she's asking me for a large sum of money again. So, I've decided to reject her request. If she's truly facing such a difficult situation, she should turn to her parents and uncles for support instead of asking me. Although we are good friends, when it comes to financial matters, I don't think I should keep helping her like this. Otherwise, it might damage our relationship. Therefore, I'm determined to say no to her this time.
