Right now, we are establishing our project, and my leader is an architect. he hasn't finished the architectural design yet. So currently, we have a lot of time to study some knowledge related to the project requirements. Today, I spent a great deal of time learning about payment systems. I spent approximately 4 hours watching videos to learn how to develop a payment project.

I also spend more than an hour practicing my English after I finish my work. Then, I use this time to study English on my way back home. When I arrive at my apartment, I watch some English videos and write my diary. I think it's really beneficial for me to practice English in this way. I shouldn't give up on learning English and should practice it every day.

I plan to go to bed early this evening because tomorrow morning I'm going to get up early to do some exercise or work out. These days, I haven't spent any time improving my physical condition. I think it's not healthy, so I should make it a habit to get up early and exercise.
