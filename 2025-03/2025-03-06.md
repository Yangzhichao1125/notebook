I think I passed the interview yesterday because when I was answering the interview questions, I felt that I could answer them pretty well. Also, I was able to finish the coding task and convey my thought process to the interviewer. So, I'm confident that I passed the interview yesterday.

I spent almost three hours preparing. And I'm familiar with most of the questions. Not all of them, but I think it was enough. The company I'm considering is an e-commerce company. It sells goods on the internet, which is really suitable for my skills. Also, there are two more interviews that I need to pass. If I pass all three of these interviews, I can join this company.

After finishing my interview, I just didn't have enough motivation to do any difficult work. So, I just played video games with my friend and watched some videos until 12:00. This made me feel really tired because yesterday afternoon, I didn't take a nap due to being nervous about the interview. Well, yesterday, I should have gone to bed early, but because I was watching something, I didn't.
 
I'm going to learn some AI courses from the Internet. It's a course about DeepSeek and Coursor, two cutting-edge tools in the AI field.
