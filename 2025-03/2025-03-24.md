Our company encountered a big problem today. We changed our requirements because our team leader told us today that our payment project had been delayed. Maybe it was because the project manager misunderstood what our boss meant, so we won't be going to develop this payment project.

On the other hand, we need to divide our team into two groups. One group needs to support the User Increase Project, and the other group needs to analyze our main project to figure out which part of the project needs improvement. That's what we are going to do. 

However, the problem is that we don't have the source code or the documents. So we don't have enough materials for development because the project belongs to the Hong Kong side, and they don't allow us to access some aspects of the project. So we only have the project website, and we need to analyze the project's future prospects. Then we need to ask the Hong Kong team to provide us with some materials so that we can develop this project.

We just think this strategy isn't reliable because we don't understand the requirements. We only have the project, and we need to improve something for this project. It really seems ridiculous for the developers. Some of our colleagues think that maybe we need to find a new job because this company isn't reliable.
