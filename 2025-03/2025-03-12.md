Today, I had a physical examination for joining the new company.
The examination shows that my body is pretty healthy.
Tomorrow I'm going to start my next job.
I'm a little worried about my next job because the salary is pretty high, and I don't have enough confidence that I can handle the job well. 
But I keep telling myself that I need to focus on the fundamental knowledge and skills. If I have a solid foundation, it will help me deal with a lot of challenging problems.
I think it's fine if I try my best to handle my job. I can perform well.
Regarding my relationship with my girlfriend, actually, I haven't made a decision yet about whether I should break up with her. Objectively speaking, I think I should break up with her. This is because she doesn't encourage me, and she hasn't made my life better. All things considered, from a rational perspective, it seems that breaking up is the right choice. However, when it comes to emotions, I don't want to end the relationship. After all, we have been together for more than three years, and it's really difficult for me to part ways with her.
Maybe this weekend I will have a conversation with her to talk about our future.
