I'm going to participate in an important interview today. There is a problem. I feel panicked because I didn't sleep well last night. Maybe it's because I feel so much pressure. So I couldn't sleep well.

I don't know why. Even though this time I just need to answer some questions, just like before, and I've prepared well, I still feel nervous. I don't know how to solve this problem. Maybe I'll talk about this problem and try to deal with this situation by having a conversation with an AI app. I hope this app can give me some advice.

I'm also thinking about learning a new skill related to large language models. Yesterday, I had a conversation with an AI app, and my purpose is to achieve financial freedom in the future. Considering my technical skills and experience, the AI app suggested that I learn LLM and prepare for my future career.

I think it's a good suggestion, but I need to spend about 2 hours a day learning this new skill. Maybe I should stop using my cellphoneï¼Œ because every day I waste a lot of time watching movies or videos on it. So, if I stop using my cellphone excessively and use that time to learn new skills instead, perhaps in two years' time, I can master these new skills if I practice them every day for two hours.

At the beginning, I think maybe I can spend half an hour a day practicing this new skill because two hours seems too long. I don't think I can keep it up for a long time.
