Today, I had a conversation with my colleagues, and some of them are truly awesome. They have really good experience in the backend development aspect. I think they are really great.

One of my colleagues, whose name is Musk, he is 36 years old. He really has rich experience in backend development. In particular, he has also worked for Alibaba and some other really great companies in China.

But because of some choices he made, they weren't correct. Maybe it was because in 2018, he chose to buy a house in Beijing. He needed to have a house in Beijing so that his child could study there. So at that time, he bought a house. But right now, the price of the house has dropped a lot. As a result, he has lost a lot of money. And at that time, he had an opportunity to work in another city as part of a team. However, because of the house, he decided not to go to that city. So it really wasn't good for his career.
