Today is Saturday, which means it's the weekend. So, I don't have enough motivation to write my diary and practice answering interview questions.

I also stayed up last night. I played video games with my friends until 2:00 am.

Right now, I can reflect on what happened yesterday.

I used a software program to help me answer interview questions.

It is an AI software program. And when I need to do some coding tests, this software program can give me some advice to help me complete these coding tasks.

I also paid for this AI software application, and I think this investment is worthwhile.

So today, I also need to practice for my English interview. But actually, I don't feel like I have enough motivation to do it. I think I'll force myself to practice for at least half an hour today.
