I feel a little panicked because in these two weeks, I've just passed two interviews. I don't have too many opportunities to get more interviews. Maybe it's because of my expected salary. I think my expected salary is too high, so I can't get enough opportunities to participate in interviews. But for these two recent interviews, I want to join a big company because I think big companies are more reliable.

Right now, I don't have enough motivation to prepare for my interview questions. I just want to play video games and scroll through my cellphone.

Maybe I will choose the previously interviewed company, because I don't need to prepare for interview questions anymore, and I can use this time to play video games. Yesterday, I just played all day. And today I also want to play a new video game with my friend.

And I will also spend half an hour learning an AI course. I think I should practice my AI skills every day because it's really important for my career. Even though I don't have enough motivation, I should force myself to learn AI skills for at least half an hour every day. Just like I write in my diary every day, I think it's really important for myself.
