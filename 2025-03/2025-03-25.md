Actually, I feel really exhausted with my job right now because I think our team leader isn't reliable. For our technical team, we don't have sufficient requirements for development. So our team is just trying to gather some requirements. And he asks us to do a lot of work. Some of the tasks are like we need to conduct some tests, do some front-end work, analyze the systems of other teams, and then assess their future prospects. After that, we need to optimize those aspects. All these kinds of things make me feel that our technical team isn't reliable.

Yesterday, I had a conversation with two of my other colleagues and we talked about our thoughts. They also think that our team isn't reliable. Well, perhaps they are all considering other job opportunities. During weekdays, they are doing the work for our company, and on weekends, they might be preparing for job interviews in the hope of joining other companies.
