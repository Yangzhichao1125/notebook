this is my first time using Obsidian.

I've realized that I need to land a job this month, so I have to prepare for interviews. There are a lot of things I need to do every day. For instance, I need to keep a diary and refrain from watching videos between 9:00 am and 6:00 pm. I also need to come up with more than five interview questions in English. Additionally, I have to conduct mock interviews.

  

Every day, I spend a great deal of time on these tasks. It can be tiring, but it makes my days fulfilling because I have so much to do. As a result, I don't have time to dwell on frustrating things, which is actually good for me.
