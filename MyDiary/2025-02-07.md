These days, I've been feeling frustrated, uncomfortable, and lacking in confidence. I realize that this kind of mindset is unproductive and won't benefit my future or career. However, I can't seem to stop these thoughts. 

I know I need to solve this problem, as it's just like any other problem I've faced. Whenever I encounter an issue, I have to find a way to resolve it. So, right now, I must look for some methods to address this lack of confidence. 

This is truly important because without a strong mindset, when I come across other problems or difficult situations in the future, I won't have the strength to deal with them. Therefore, I think it's essential for me to take some time to boost my confidence and strengthen my mental attitude.
