These days, I've been feeling frustrated, uncomfortable, and lacking in confidence. I realize that this kind of mindset is unproductive and won't benefit my future or career. However, I can't seem to stop these thoughts. 

I know I need to solve this problem, as it's just like any other problem I've faced. Whenever I encounter an issue, I have to find a way to resolve it. So, right now, I must look for some methods to address this lack of confidence. 

This is truly important because without a strong mindset, when I come across other problems or difficult situations in the future, I won't have the strength to deal with them. Therefore, I think it's essential for me to take some time to boost my confidence and strengthen my mental attitude.

According to traditional thinking, we should take care of others and avoid being selfish. However, based on my 32 years of life experience, I think being selfish might be a better option. When we focus on taking care of others, expending all our money, time, and energy on them, we often get little in return. On the other hand, if we direct these resources other hand, if we direct these resources towards ourselves, we can grow stronger more rapidly. So, I believe the first thing I need to do is become more self - centered. Even though this may not be considered morally correct in a traditional sense, from my personal experience, being more selfish can improve my life.

Today, the top priority for me is to boost my confidence. Therefore, I'll channel all my energy into this task. I believe the first step is to make myself fully aware that I need to look out for myself. After all, if I don't take care of myself, who will? So, I must place myself first. If there are people who make me feel frustrated or anxious, I'll simply distance myself from them. I won't concern myself with their thoughts or pay attention to them.

This mindset will serve as the foundation for all my actions. Subsequently, I have to discover methods to build up my confidence.
