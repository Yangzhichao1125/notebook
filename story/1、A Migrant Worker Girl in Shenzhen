Today I'm going to tell a story about a migrant worker girl in Shenzhen.
This girl was born in 1994.
She looks very young and her voice is also very soft.
Well, for migrant worker girls, their family situations are generally not very good.
When she was a child, her family's living standard was just average among those in the village.
However, when she was in the first grade of senior high school, something unexpected happened in her family.
Her father had a stroke. 
Due to the failure to seek medical treatment in a timely manner 
and the fact that the doctor they found at that time was unreliable, 
her father became paralyzed in both lower limbs and couldn't get out of bed.
The economic situation of her family became even worse, like adding insult to injury.
At that time, her family couldn't afford to support her schooling anymore.
She was quite sensible. Because of what had happened, on the one hand, 
she went back home to take care of her father, 
and on the other hand, she did some odd jobs in the village to earn a little extra money to support the family.
Life was really tight for them.
After more than two years, 
her former classmates who used to study with her either went to universities in other places or went out to work in other cities. Her mother also thought that since her daughter had grown up, staying in this small village would lead to no future. It would be better to let her daughter go out and work, so that she could earn more money.
She agreed and then set off for Shenzhen.
