In this episode, we're going to talk more about the change in mindset, especially regarding traditional thinking. Traditionally, as men, we're taught that we need to take care of our wives and children. We're expected to provide a great deal of emotional support. However, in a relationship, if you rely solely on this kind of strategy, it's not beneficial for your relationship. The traditional mindset often makes the man fall into the role of a one - sided supporter. He ends up pouring all his emotional resources into supporting his partner and family, and over time, the woman may start to view this as ordinary. She might think that what he does is nothing special, and thus, she may not find him attractive. After a while, she may even seek out other relationships with men who can offer her different emotional experiences.

  

So, this episode emphasizes that we need to change our mindset. We shouldn't stick to the traditional approach as it can be detrimental to our relationships.


The teacher then told us not to do certain things. Here are the points:

  

First, while being a gentleman is good, there are limits. You don't always have to open the door for her or do overly convenient things like putting food on her plate during dinner. These actions, on their own, may not add significant value in the eyes of the girl.

  

Second, there's a sense of not over - coddling the girl. For instance, when she has a fever or is sick, you don't necessarily have to rush medicine to her immediately. And when she's angry, you don't have to send food as a consolation. In general, you don't need to be overly accommodating to everyone. If you lack your own principles, others may take advantage of you. So, you must have your own framework and be able to express your thoughts directly.

  

Third, don't always agree with the girl. If she asks you to buy something and you don't want to, simply don't do it because you don't concur.

  

Fourth, regarding the "lady first" concept, when going out for dinner with a girl, you don't have to let her have exclusive control over the menu. You should also be able to choose what you want to eat.

  

Fifth, before establishing a relationship, you don't need to be overly fixated on one person and say things like "I only love you and no one else."

  

Sixth, don't refrain from expressing your emotions. If you have feelings or thoughts, just say them.

  

Seventh, don't change yourself completely according to the girl's standards. If you do, you might end up losing your identity, and she may not love you for who you truly are.

  

Based on these eight points, the key seems to be that you need to be more self - centered in a sense, taking care of your own emotions. If you have genuine value, showcase it to the girl, and then she may be more likely to follow your lead.

  

It's important to note that while these ideas aim to re - balance relationship dynamics, they should be applied with nuance. Every relationship is different, and it's about finding a healthy middle ground.
