Today, we're going to discuss impression rather than just appearance. When it comes to making an impression, if you can leave a great one on others, it's truly remarkable. An impression encompasses not only physical appearance like face, height, etc., but also elements related to visual appeal, touch, and smell. In fact, the impression you make is more important than just your looks.

  

You see, every girl often doesn't fall in love with the real you, but rather with an imagined ideal man. They all want to be a princess and hope for a prince. According to this course, by learning step - by - step, you can become that prince in a girl's mind. The first key point is that you need to have a good appearance, not only in terms of looking presentable but also in a way that makes others think, "Wow, this is really an outstanding man." If you pay attention to the impression you create on others, they'll find you amazing. When girls consider having a relationship or marrying you, they'll lower their demands. For example, if you don't have a great appearance or seem to lack certain values, a girl might ask you for more money, like asking you to buy a house. However, if you're truly attractive, she might think that this man doesn't need an overly high - maintenance girlfriend. So, if she wants to marry you, she'll reduce her requirements. She might not demand a large sum of money, numerous gifts, or a house for the wedding. Thus, learning this course can potentially save you a lot of money.

  

The first crucial thing is to improve your appearance. This doesn't necessarily require a great deal of effort, money, or energy, but the pay - off can be significant. It's not just about looks; your behavior also matters. If you're an attractive person, even when you meet a cold - hearted woman, you can still connect with her and have a good conversation. This is actually very important.

  

The teacher also mentioned that if you follow this course, it can not only bring you emotional satisfaction but also support your career. Moreover, this course can help you build a reliable relationship. That's why I'm interested in it. I really agree with the teacher's opinion because in my last relationship, I felt extremely tired. I gave a lot but received very little in return. I felt that I was being treated unfairly and was completely exhausted. Maybe in my next relationship, or perhaps if I try to rebuild my relationship with my ex - girlfriend, I hope she can help me advance my career or provide me with emotional support. That's why I want to learn this course.

  

So, the conclusion I draw from learning this course is that you need to make yourself better. If you're an excellent person, you'll attract other excellent people. You should strive to improve and grow every day. That's the key.
