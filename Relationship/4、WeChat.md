In the fourth episode, we can discuss WeChat. In China, this app is extremely popular. Virtually every individual with a cell phone has installed WeChat for communication. Thus, it's really essential to manage your WeChat profile well. When people communicate on WeChat, they can view your nickname, profile picture, and signature, as well as the content in your Moments. All of these elements are of great significance because when you have a conversation, especially on line, and you're chatting on WeChat, others will see this information. So, adopting a good strategy for presenting yourself on WeChat is really important.

  

The first key aspect is your profile photo. Every time you engage in a conversation, your profile photo is visible to the other person immediately. The teacher suggests that you should use a real photo of yourself. Avoid using cartoon images or pictures of internet or Instagram celebrities as your profile photo. This is because showing your real self in the photo is a good way to demonstrate your value. It's especially crucial as others can see it directly every time you communicate with them.

  

Next is the nickname. Don't choose a strange or unprofessional name that might make people think you're unreliable. Instead, pick a name that conveys maturity and reliability.

  

Then there's the signature. You should also put some thought into it. Come up with a signature that showcases your value and makes you seem attractive.

  

Finally, consider your WeChat Moments. You can share various aspects of your life, such as your hobbies, work, and friends. The most important thing, though, is to use Moments to display your abilities, value, and attractiveness. For instance, when taking a photo with someone to share on Moments, avoid choosing to pose with a particularly handsome person. If you post this photo on social media, others might ask you who that person is, which could be a bit awkward. Just keep in mind that through WeChat, especially in your Moments, you should focus on showing your own value and attractiveness. That's the most vital point.
