In this episode, we discussed outfits. When considering our appearance, after talking about our face, haircut, and skin, we also need to pay attention to what we wear. Choosing the right outfit style can create a good first impression on others. So, outfits are really important.

  

The first thing to keep in mind is to avoid choosing awful clothes or pants. You don't need to go for overly fashionable styles or clothes with too many colors, as these are often not suitable for most ordinary people. As an average person, you should opt for simple styles. Focus on three colors - black, gray, white, and maybe you can add a deep blue. Trust me, when selecting your outfit, don't use more than three colors. Also, be careful about your shoes. Don't choose bright - colored ones; stick to the same three colors that match your clothes and pants.

  

Next, let's talk about styles. There are several styles you can choose from. For example, you can go for a slightly mature style, a Japanese or Korean style, or an Instagram - inspired style. You can also consider a business style. For me, I don't like the Japanese style because I don't think it's suitable for a 31 - year - old man. Maybe if I were 20, I'd choose it, but it's not right for me at the moment. The Instagram style isn't suitable for me either. It takes a lot of time to figure out what works, and often, it's hard to pull off. So, I'd suggest choosing a slightly mature style or a Korean style. I think the slightly mature style is versatile. It's appropriate not only for casual outings but also for the workplace.

  

However, the teacher highly recommends the business style. This is because it suits every man, regardless of body shape - whether you're fat or thin, tall or short. You can customize the suit, and when a man wears a well - fitted suit, it gives off an air of sexiness and maturity. Women can sense a certain security from a man in a suit. But for me, when I buy a suit, I don't feel like wearing it for casual outings. I think it's too formal, especially when I'm just going out to meet a girl. Wearing a suit might make our conversation feel a bit stiff. So, I'd choose the slightly mature style as I think it's the most suitable for me.
