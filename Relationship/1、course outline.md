That discourse includes three key points. The first point is about "what is a 'supporter' in a relationship". You see, in a relationship, there are two types of roles: the supporter and the lover. If you find yourself in the role of a supporter, it indicates that your relationship might be in a less - than - ideal state. Thus, it's advisable to transform into a lover, which can enhance the relationship and bring you more advantages within it. So, let's define what a supporter is. 

The answer is, if you feel that you invest a great deal, whether it's in terms of material things or emotional support, yet receive very little in return from the relationship, then you are a supporter. It could be that you provide certain items or offer emotional sustenance. Regardless of the form, if the input - output ratio seems skewed in this way, you fit the description of a supporter.

  

The second point is whether you are currently a supporter or might become one in the future. Many people start a relationship on an equal footing. However, over time, perhaps after several instances of giving, like buying gifts or providing money to their partner without expecting much in return, they gradually turn into supporters. This shift can pose numerous challenges if they aim to get married or maintain a healthy relationship.

  

The third point is, if you've already become a supporter, is there any way or opportunity to change the situation and improve your relationship? The answer is yes. You can learn some tips or methods from this course to enhance your relationship.
