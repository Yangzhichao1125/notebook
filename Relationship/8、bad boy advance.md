In this episode, we'll discuss four advanced tips for the "bad boy" persona that can attract more girls. 

**First Point: Confidence** Some people believe that confidence is built through achievements or possessions. However, the teacher emphasizes that true confidence doesn't rely on anything external. You simply need to be inherently confident. For example, if a girl comments that you're short, you could respond, "That's because the world is fair. God gave me an excellent, smart brain and a handsome face. If I were also tall, it would be unfair to other men." From this example, you can see the man exuding confidence. You need to reinforce in your mind that you're an outstanding, high - value man. Even if you feel you lack in other areas, having confidence can make a girl perceive you as a high - value individual. 


**Second Point: The Unexpected** Avoid being predictable. Instead of doing the typical things like sending money to a girl on Valentine's Day or other festivals, try something different. For instance, on her birthday, you could say, "Wow, I forgot your birthday." She'll likely feel disappointed. Then, when you're at the park, ask her to get a bottle from the trunk of your car. When she opens it, she sees the gift she's been wanting. This kind of unexpected experience creates a powerful impact. Once she goes through this, she'll be more likely to develop strong feelings for you. 


**Third Point: Emotional Detachment** When the girl encounters problems or says negative things to you, to the point where you might think you're about to lose her, don't over - react. Think of it as if you have many things in your life, and losing one of them isn't a catastrophe. Don't let your emotions get the better of you. This shows that you're not overly dependent on her and have a sense of self - control. 



**Fourth Point: Self - Focus** You should prioritize yourself. You can think of this as being extremely self - centered. Have your own values, framework, and principles. By focusing on improving yourself and becoming better and better, you'll attract many excellent girls. This self - improvement is the key. It's important to note that while these tips are presented as relationship - building strategies, they should be used with caution. In a healthy relationship, mutual respect, understanding, and communication are fundamental. These techniques should enhance rather than replace these core elements.
