In the last episode, we discussed how the traditional concept of being a “good boy” or a “good person” might not be advantageous in a relationship. In this episode, we're going to talk about the so - called “bad boy” approach. Apparently, if you adopt a “bad boy” persona in a relationship, you might gain more benefits and attract more girls to like or admire you. You need to follow these four points:

  

First, you need to cultivate a mindset where you don't overly concern yourself with the girl's feelings. Tell yourself that if you were to lose an excellent girl, it's quite normal. It's not a major catastrophe. Of course, having a relationship with her would be great, but if it doesn't work out, it's not the end of the world. When you have this kind of mindset, it will transform your behavior. You won't experience excessive pressure during conversations or while doing activities, and you'll come across as more natural. So, this mindset is truly crucial.

  

Second, you need to have certain attractive elements. What I mean is that you can engage in actions to gradually close the distance between you two. However, you must follow a principle and proceed step by step. For example, it would be inappropriate to kiss her upon first meeting; that's too forward. Instead, start with simple gestures. During a conversation, you could begin with a light hand touch, then progress to a shoulder touch. After that, you might give her a hug. There are different types of hugs, like a shoulder - to - shoulder hug, and then a full embrace. Following that, you could try an ear whisper. And the next step could be a kiss. But don't use tongue on the first kiss. Maybe save that for the next time. If you follow these steps and kiss her a few times, the likelihood of starting a relationship is quite high.

  

It should be noted that while this is presented as a relationship strategy, it's important to always respect the other person's boundaries and consent in any real - life interaction. Building a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect, communication, and understanding.


The third point is that you shouldn't be concerned about her negative thoughts regarding you. When you're having a conversation or spending time with a girl, she might make some negative comments or remarks about you. Simply ignore them. If you show that you're overly bothered by her saying something negative, she'll perceive you as a person of low value. So, when she utters such negative statements, just brush them off. This will make her think that you're a high - value person who doesn't sweat the small stuff. This is truly important. As for the final point, you need to shift your perspective on rewards. You should tell yourself that when you're in a relationship with her, you are the reward for her. It's quite challenging for many men to think this way because a lot of people wrongly assume that the girlfriend is the reward when in a relationship. To adopt this mindset, you can use certain techniques. For instance, when she hands you a bottle of water, you could say, "Wow, you're so thoughtful." When she cooks food for you, you can exclaim, "Wow, you're an amazing cook!" If she pays for the beer when you're out, you might say, "You're so special. I've never met a girl like you." By using such compliments, you make the girl feel that being with you places her in a position where you're of higher value. This can strengthen your relationship because, generally, people tend to admire those they perceive as stronger or of higher value, just like how a princess might admire a high - value prince. It's important to approach relationships with authenticity and respect. While these strategies might seem appealing on the surface, they should be balanced with genuine care and communication to build a healthy and long - lasting connection.
